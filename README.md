# Password Generator

## Description

The goal of this project was to generate a randomized password based on user inputted criteria. It allows for the creation of a safe to use, completely random password that can be made on command.

This project was made to teach me how to use the basics of JavaScript and its different abilities, such as for loops, functions, if statements, scope, variables, etc. I learned how to use all of these things and more, and it helped build my understanding on all of these topics immensely.
